# Universal-Parse-Tool
An all in one tool to parse out any CDR from any gateway with auto detection of type

App auto detects a voice based 2N and Quescom CDR file(s) or a Hypermedia SMS CDR and parses out each individual sims total usage
over the period of the data.  

#Lessons
Uses way better OOP principles and for the first time I'v explored and used Interfaces.  On top of that I've structured the file tree
into neat and organised packages for ease of maintnenance.

#Result
Tool has been rolled out to my support colleagues who are using it
